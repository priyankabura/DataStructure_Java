EulerTour.java - driver program which reads the input graph, breaks the graph into tours, stick the tours to form a euler tour and finally verifies whether it is a valid eulerian graph, if its valid then prints the euler tour.

Element.java - It holds the vertex and incident edge class objects, which acts as input type for circular list.

CircularList.java - Generic class that implements circular linked list along with an iterator implementation.

Graph.java - Represents a graph class with following functions implemented: ReadGraph, BreakIntoTours, StitchTours and VerifyTour

Edge.java - Class that represents each edge of a graph

Vertex.java - Class that represents each vertex in a graph
